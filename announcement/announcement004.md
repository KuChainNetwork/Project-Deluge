## Official Close of KuChain Betanet Events Phase I



**Dear participants:**




On  July 1st, 2020, together with developer communities such as Cosmos and GoLang, cyber security expert institutions including Chaitin, PeckShield and SlowMist, as well as various partners that have made commitments on contributing to KuChain’s future ecosystem prosperity, the KuChain team launched KuChain Betanet Events to receive both conceptual and technical “baptism” from the public as a newborn.

After a month of "baptism", we have fixed 10 vulnerabilities and got 13 valid proposals, KuChain Betanet network now becomes more secure and stable! Thanks for your active participation and contribution!

Here we announce that KuChain Betanet Events first phase comes to its successful close on 2020.08.07 10:00am (UTC+8) !

Based on the the awards statistics as follows, we now step into the appeal period of one week from 2020.08.07 10:00am to 2020.08.14 10:00am (UTC+8). Awards will be paid out in KCS to ERC-20 addresses of the following winners one week after the appeal period.

To ensure that winners could get their awards after the appeal period, we have contacted them in private. If you are one of the winners, please check your email.

Now you might be curious of our next step, here is a kindly heads-up that KuChain Betanet Events second phase of economic model testing will be launched soon. Please stay tuned!




Regards

KuChain Team
