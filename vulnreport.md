## Description

I Just Started hunting on your bug bounty program and came across a vulnerability that can cause a data leak.

Vulnerability - Credentials Exposure

## Steps to Reproduce

I just searched a query on your github respository and came across a database file exposed publically and it may cause a huge data loss.

File link - https://github.com/KuChainNetwork/kratos/blob/5c056369a6a0e95c5976fe93bfe6bd9a4c5c4cf2/scripts/configs/plugins.json
